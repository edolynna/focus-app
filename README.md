<h1 align="left">React Focus App</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p align="left">This is a Timer application built using React. The app allows users to focus on their work for a set period, followed by a short break. It tracks the time using a circular progress bar and offers play, pause, and settings functionality. The timer switches automatically between work and break modes and can be customized based on user preferences.</p>

    <li><strong>Work and Break Modes:</strong> The app alternates between work and break modes, helping users follow the Pomodoro technique (e.g., 45-minute work session, followed by a 5-minute break).</li>
    <li><strong>Circular Progress Bar:</strong> The time remaining is displayed on a circular progress bar that dynamically updates as the timer counts down.</li>
    <li><strong>Play/Pause Controls:</strong> Users can start or pause the timer at any time with the play/pause button.</li> <li><strong>Automatic Mode Switch:</strong> The app automatically switches between work and break modes once the time is up.</li> <li><strong>Customizable Time Intervals:</strong> Users can customize the duration of the work and break periods via settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent State:</strong> The timer maintains the current sessionâ€™s state and resets properly when the mode switches.</li>
